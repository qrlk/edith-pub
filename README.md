# edith-pub

This is my personal [moonloader](https://gtaforums.com/topic/890987-moonloader/) project that I worked on in 2019-2021.  

The idea was to put everything needed by a small group of GTA SA-MP players (squad, guild etc.) in one file, protect its use with a password and make it possible to synchronize module data through the server between users (navigation, shared killlist).

In my case, there are 30 modules with different functionality, most of them are focused on simplifying the gameplay of the biker faction on the [samp-rp project](https://samp-rp.ru/).

I published it because there are a lot of small closed groups of players playing on samp role servers, which could use a similar modular script that can be built on the example of edith-pub.
